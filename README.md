# ðŸ“˜ Learning Session Code
## Overview
This repository contains the code from my learning sessions while taking the Python for Data Analytics course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.
It documents the concepts and techniques I am learning across various modules, helping build a strong foundation in Python for data science and analytics.

Note: I am currently progressing through the course. I will update the repository as I complete additional modules.

## Key Concepts Covered
### Module 1: Python Basics
Core Python topics: variables, data types, loops, functions, and basic data structures.

### Module 2: Data Analysis with Pandas
Working with pandas for data import/export, cleaning, filtering, and summarizing DataFrames.

### Module 3: Data Visualization
Creating visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn (line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms).

### Upcoming Modules
Statistical inference

Regression modeling

Time series analysis

Technologies Used
Python
