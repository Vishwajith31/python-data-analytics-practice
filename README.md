- Creating variables, performing operations.

- Manipulating data with pandas DataFrames.

### Module 2: Data Analysis with Pandas
- Sorting, filtering, and aggregating data.

- Summarizing data with descriptive statistics.

### Module 3: Data Visualization
- Building scatter plots, line charts, and bar charts.

- Applying styling and annotations.

### Module 4: Regression & Statistical Inference
- Conducting t-tests, building regression models.

- Interpreting statistical outputs like p-values and R-squared.

### Module 5: Time Series Forecasting
- Handling DateTime data.

- Forecasting trends using moving averages and seasonal decomposition.

## Tools and Techniques
- Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive coding environment.

- pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn: Data manipulation and visualization.

- Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing and regression.
