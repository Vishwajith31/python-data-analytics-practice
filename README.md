# 📘 Learning Session Code
## Overview
This repository contains the code from my learning sessions while taking the Python for Data Analytics course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.
It documents the concepts and techniques I am learning across various modules, helping build a strong foundation in Python for data science and analytics.

## Note: I am currently progressing through the course. I will update the repository as I complete additional modules.

## Key Concepts Covered
### Module 1: Python Basics
- Core Python topics: variables, data types, loops, functions, and basic data structures.

### Module 2: Data Analysis with Pandas
- Working with pandas for data import/export, cleaning, filtering, and summarizing DataFrames.

### Module 3: Data Visualization
- Creating visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn (line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms).

### Module 4: Statistical Inference & Regression
- Basics of hypothesis testing: t-tests, confidence intervals.

- Building simple and multiple linear regression models.

### Module 5: Time Series Analysis
- Working with DateTime objects to handle time-based data.

- Techniques like resampling, segmentation, forecasting trends and seasonality.

## Technologies
- Python: Core programming language.

- pandas: Data manipulation.

- NumPy: Numerical operations.

- matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.

- scikit-learn: Basic machine learning models.
